## Introuction
Consider a financial institution, for example a bank, who is in the business of providing their clients loans and makes profit on the accrued interest. Ideally, the business would like to maximize their profits and wants to know if they can provide loans with as close to a 100% pay back rate as possible. The business question we try to solve as well as the goal of this analysis, is to leverage a clientâ€™s financial data to see if it is possible to predict whether or not a potential client will default or fully pay off their loan. Ultimately, we want to be able to analyze the risk of a given loan before it is given and advise the potential crediting association.

The model can possibly be useful for financial institutions who would like to optimize their profits from interest while minimizing their losses. This model takes the input data of a client and outputs a prediction of whether a client will default or fully pay as well as their respective probabilities. A business can utilize this result to design an algorithm that leverages these probabilities to calculate the optimal risk they would like to take. This could be in the form of how much they willing are to loan based on how probable the risk of default is. Another important consideration is how to deal with the opportunity cost when the prediction is incorrect. Suppose a client is predicted to default but in actuality would have paid off his loan and the bank does not approve the loan. In this scenario the bank would have lost the opportunity to profit from the interest that would have been made otherwise. In this area, further research could be done in how much the bank loses on a default compared with how much profit they make on interest.
